Celsius to Fahrenheit	° F = 9/5 ( ° C) + 32

Kelvin to Fahrenheit	° F = 9/5 (K - 273) + 32

Fahrenheit to Celsius	° C = 5/9 (° F - 32)

Celsius to Kelvin	K = ° C + 273

Kelvin to Celsius	° C = K - 273

Fahrenheit to Kelvin	K = 5/9 (° F - 32) + 273


NOTE: If you you are trying to multiply/divide between integer and floating point number in C# project, you need to put "f" character to it's end. (int) => (float)  

Example

F = 9/5f (C) + 32

or..

F = 9f/5 (C) + 32
